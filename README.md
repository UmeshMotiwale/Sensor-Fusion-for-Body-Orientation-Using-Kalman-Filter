ðŸ“Œ Project: Orientation Estimation using Kalman Filtering

Course: SC651 â€“ Kalman Filtering

ðŸ”§ Hardware & Tools

ESP32-WROVER B microcontroller

LSM9DS1 9-DOF IMU (Accelerometer + Gyroscope + Magnetometer)

Arduino IDE for programming

ðŸ§  Project Overview

Developed an orientation estimation system to compute real-time roll, pitch, and yaw using sensor fusion. The system leverages raw data from the LSM9DS1 IMU and applies a Kalman Filter to fuse gyroscope and accelerometer measurements, achieving high accuracy orientation tracking on an ESP32 platform.

ðŸš€ Implementation Highlights

Implemented gyroscope-only integration and accelerometer-only estimation as baseline methods.

Designed and coded the Kalman Filtering algorithm to combine both sensor readings.

Fine-tuned noise covariance matrices (Ïƒw, Ïƒv) and initial filter parameters for optimized performance.

Achieved ~98% accuracy in orientation estimation, validated through comparison with raw sensor methods.

Visualized results in Arduino Serial Plotter for real-time analysis.# Sensor-Fusion-for-Body-Orientation-Using-Kalman-Filter
